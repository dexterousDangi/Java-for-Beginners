# first-for-me
first of its kind
many shall come after you,
when i was tired of lossing games
there you come a perfect volley.
Ooo first of its kind
you make all my past futile efforts feel like 
elxir for themselfs,and too seek for another one like that.
Ooo first of its kind, please come in my path of this hexgonal and pentagonal world.
you may have passed the ball, but you decided to take hit it hard and with light's speed.

// about throw keyword:  here we are having two approach of using throw keyword
// first we can use throw keyword for predefined exception modification (not a recommended approach, because we don't want to paly with predefined information)
// second we can use throw keyword for user defined exception (like in bank atm's, we get a insufficent balance exception i.e., is a user defined exception not a predefined exception in java)
//second use is recommended approach


/* there are two type of user defined exceptions: 

1) user defined checked exception- there is also two approach to create such exceptions

a) default constructor approach
b) parameterized constructor approach


2) user defined un-checked exception- there is also two approach to create such exceptions

a) default constructor approach

b) parameterized constructor approach

*/

//1) -a) creation of user defined checked exception by using default constructor approach:
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//step 1:(file no.1)


class InvalidAgeException extends Exception // by extending exception class it became checked exception class

{ // empty body
  // default constructor is generated. zero argument constructor
}


//step 2: (file no.2) use these exceptions in our application
